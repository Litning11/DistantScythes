# DistantScythes

A plugin for Minecraft that adds scythe mechanics to ItemsAdder tools. 

To use it, install the plugin and then edit the config file to list all custom item names you want to use these mechanics. Scythe mechanics allow you to right-click a fully grown block with the tool to automatically replant it, consuming a seed item and reducing durability.
